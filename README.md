# RateMyProfessor Data Analysis

## Introduction

When I was in college (last month lol), it was crucial that I had a good professor to succeed in the class. Unlike many of my friends who could easily self-learn / self-study any class, I was that one kid who was at every office hours asking questions from start to finish. One tool that I used throughout my college career was the review site called RateMyProfessors (RMP). Here, I could go through sometimes hundreds of reviews on almost every professor and use that information to schedule myself optimally. For the most part, RMP did a pretty good job at giving an overall rundown of what to expect from a professor.

## Goals

My main goal of this analysis is to take a deeper look into the specifics of these reviews and ultimately determine: ***What makes a professor good?*** Furthermore I want to develop a model that can accurately ***classify whether a review is "good" or "bad."***
